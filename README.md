## DQN Irrigation Environment

# Project Overview

This project involves training a reinforcement learning agent using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) to optimize irrigation in a simulated agricultural environment. The agent aims to efficiently water crops while avoiding obstacles such as rocks and maximizing the use of the water source.
